# C-Input-file-grader
This project was a part of my c++ class and i felt it demenstrates most of what I learned in the class.
This program takes in a file of answers to a math quiz, grades them, and outputs it to a file with the correct answers.
To open this file, Open the dev file which will show all the files needed to run this program.
First we read in the input file, asigning the fractons to numerator and denomonator values. Then we use a multitude of if statements to detirmine the operator and the use said operator.
finally, we check to see if the accutal answer equals the answer given. if so, we output correct and we add it to the counter of correct answers. if not, then we display the correct answer beside their answer. After we have done that for each question, we out put everthing to another file.
